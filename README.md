# üß≠ Rob√¥ Seguidor de Linha com Desvio de Obst√°culos

> Open-source autonomous robot designed to follow lines and avoid obstacles using **Arduino**, **infrared sensors**, and **ultrasonic distance measurement**.  
> The system applies basic robotics principles such as sensor fusion, PWM motor control, and obstacle detection logic.



## üìò Overview

This project consists of a **line-following robot** capable of navigating predefined paths based on visual contrast (black/white) and autonomously stopping or rerouting when obstacles are detected.  
It was developed for educational and experimental purposes, focusing on **embedded systems**, **automation**, and **algorithmic control**.

The codebase is modular and well-organized, divided into logical sections for **motor control**, **sensor handling**, and **decision-making routines**.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Autonomous Line Tracking** ‚Äî Follows black or white lines using infrared sensors  
- **Obstacle Avoidance** ‚Äî Detects and stops when an obstacle is near using an ultrasonic sensor  
- **PWM Motor Control** ‚Äî Smooth acceleration and directional precision  
- **Modular Firmware** ‚Äî Organized code structure with separated logic for movement and sensors  
- **Adjustable Sensitivity** ‚Äî Easily tune speed, detection range, and threshold values  
- **Open Source & Extensible** ‚Äî Built for experimentation and future robotics extensions

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cauerast/line-follower-robot.git
cd line-follower-robot
````

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Project in Arduino IDE

* Navigate to `firmware/line_follower_basic/`
* Select your Arduino board and COM port
* Upload the code to your board

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Assemble the Circuit

Follow the wiring diagram in the `/docs` folder.
Make sure to correctly connect the **L298N module** to the motor and the **infrared sensors** to the analog pins defined in the firmware.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Robot

Place the robot on a track with a **black line over a white surface** (or vice versa).
The robot will automatically start following the line and stop when an obstacle is detected.

## üß∞ Configuration

You can customize:

* **Speed** via PWM value (default: 175)
* **Detection distance** for the ultrasonic sensor (default: 175 mm)
* **Sensor polarity** depending on line color (black or white)

These values are defined in the `config.h` or directly in the main Arduino sketch.



## üî¨ Experiments & Extensions

You can extend this project by integrating:

* **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi modules** for remote control
* **PID control** for smoother and more accurate movement
* **OLED display** for telemetry visualization
* **MQTT or REST API** for IoT-based data monitoring

## üß© Educational Context

This project was created as part of a **university robotics and automation study**, with a focus on applying theoretical knowledge in:

* Embedded systems programming
* Algorithmic control logic
* Sensor integration
* Real-time response systems

Deseja que eu adicione uma se√ß√£o final tipo **‚ÄúPerformance & Testing‚Äù** (como em reposit√≥rios da Intel ou OpenVINO) com resultados de testes e sugest√µes de benchmarks (velocidade, precis√£o, curva, resposta a obst√°culos)? Isso deixaria seu README com um tom ainda mais profissional e completo.
